Algorithm_Sentence_Sort()
=========================
Input: A sentence whose words are to be sorted in alphabetical order.
Output: The sentence whose words are sorted in alphabetical order.
Data Structure Used: An array say 'str[]' has been used to store the sentence.

Steps
=====
1.	Begin
2.	Set l := length(str[])		//length() is a procedure which gives the length of an array or a string.
3.	For a = 0 to l
	Begin
3.1.		If str[a] != ' ' AND str[a] != '.' then
				Set temp := temp + str[a]
3.2.		ELSE
				Set n := n + 1
				Set word[n] := temp
				Set temp := ''
		End If
		Set a := a + 1
	End For
4.	For i = 0 to n-1
	Begin
4.1.		For j = i + 1 to n
		Begin
4.2.			If length(word[i]) < length(word[j]) then
			Set temp := word[i]
			Set word[i] := word[j]
			Set word[j] := temp
			End If
			Set j := j + 1
			End For
4.3.		If length(word[i]) = length(word[j]) then
4.4.			If (length(word[i]) - length(word[j])) > 0 then
			Set temp := word [i]
			Set word[i] := word[j]
			Set word[j] := temp
			End If
		End If
		Set i := i + 1
	End For
5.	Process(str[])			//Process() is a procedure which traverses the array or the string.
6. show()
7.	End
